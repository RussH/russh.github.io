## Security release and vulnerability news

After a detailed security audit, we have released OpenCATS version 0.9.7 which detected and corrected  several vulnerabilities. 

### Overview
@hansmach1ne identified a number of vulnerabilities on the 'internal' webpages and would require a valid username/password to reach. It's been greatly appreciated by the project that these vulnerabilities were checked and mitigating PR's proposed. 

I'm very appreciative of the work that they've put in here and once the release is produced will share it on the project website.

Mitigation steps - I'd always recommend users / admins read the security guidelines and think carefully for themselves https://github.com/opencats/OpenCATS/wiki/Security-Considerations which actually include mention of some of these 'internal facing' vulnerabilities

### Remediation
We recommend that you upgrade your opencats instance asap.

If you wish to apply a fix instead, please view the changes in the github PR instead.

### Thanks
We are extremely grateful to @hansmach1ne for finding these vulnerability and proposing remediation steps.
